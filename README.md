## 📖 Project Overview

This repository showcases **two core applications** of DuckDB in AI projects:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application**:
   - Use DuckDB as a vector database to enhance AI models with real-time, relevant context retrieval.
   - Combine embeddings with SQL queries to provide AI with memory-like capabilities.

2. **Natural Language Query Engine**:
   - Empower non-technical users to query structured data using natural language.
   - Convert natural language inputs into SQL queries and retrieve actionable insights.
